# CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycle

This is a project done for my Software Development Lifecycle course through SNHU.

In this document, I take on the role of a Scrum Master in an Agile-Scrum development enviroment, and I help facilitate a Sprint Review and Retrospective. This is based off of the development of a Travel website that the team is currently working on.


# QUESTIONS

-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To effectively interpret user needs, I try to look at the application as if I am a customer myself, and envision how I would want to the program to look and feel. To understand exactly what the customer is wanting to get from the program, you have to look at it from their perspective, and think about what they would want to do with it and how they could do it. User stories can be helpful for this by putting these ideas into a written form in order for different audiences to understand it. For example, it can allow both stakeholders and developers to understand features that will be implemented into these programs, so that they remain on the same page as far as what type of functionality the program will have.

-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

At first, I try to look at the programs development as a whole and create a big picture idea of how it should go. Once I have a general understanding of what the program needs to do, then I can go in and fill in the smaller details as we go. Using an Agile method helps with this because it allows the development process to be fluid and adaptable, based on changing needs and requirements. Using the Scrum framework is also a good way to manage a project, because it incorporates structures and events that can help increase collaboration and keep everyone aligned on the projects goals. Examples of this includes daily standups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in a software development environment means to be transparent, communicative, and focused. Being transparent is important because helps build trust, accountability, and keeps everyone aligned on the same goals. Being communicative is important because reduces misunderstandings, saves time, and increases collaboration. Last, but not least, staying focused is important because it improves your problem solving skills, can speed up develpment, and can increase communication.
